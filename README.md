Atmospheric Image Correction And Removal Of Cloud Cover For Satellite Images And Classification Of Water, Land And Vegetation.

Land-use classification, urban geographic mapping, and change detection are all common applications for remote sensing photography. Cloudiness causes missing data and spatiotemporal discontinuities, which affects how well time series are applied. Data usefulness can be improved by reconstructing contaminated areasin cloudy satellite imagery. The objective of this project is to clear the satellite photos of haze and cloud cover. This is done mainly by using the S2cloudless algorithm for cloud removal and the Dark Channel Prior algorithm for haze removal in satellite images.
The image areas are divided into additional categories, such as agricultural lands, natural vegetation, and bodies of standing water. This is done for a variety of purposes, including environmental monitoring, agriculture and forestry, and urban planning. Efforts to manage disasters and respond to them can also be supported by accurate land cover classification.
The methodology for this work is selection of satellite data; use of suitable methods for classification and identifying vegetation areas. We use K-means Clustering for Unsupervised Clustering and Supervised Classification is performed using Segmentation and Random Forest Classifier.
